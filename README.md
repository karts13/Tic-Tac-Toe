# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
> An easy-to-use, interactive game experience is offered by this C++ program *Tic-Tac-Toe* , which applies object-oriented ideas. It makes use of classes, functions, > and random number generation. The game has two modes:
> 1. **Play Against a Human:** Two players enter their moves sequentially on the 3x3 game board in this mode. Players can start new games and the program keeps track of their scores.
> 2. **Play Against the Computer:** In this mode, a lone player faces off against an artificially intelligent foe. The player attempts to win or earn a draw while the computer performs random moves.

## How to Use this Code
> 1. Create a new text file with a ".cpp" extension, e.g., `tictactoe.c`.
> 2. Copy the code from [tictactoe.c](https://github.com/karts13/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/main/tictactoe.cpp) repository and paste it into the text editor.
> 3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler such as G++ (GNU C++ Compiler) or any other compilers.
> 4. Do the necessary [customizations](https://github.com/karts13/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/main/README.md#customization).
> 5. After successful compilation, an executable file named `tictactoe` will be generated. Run the compiled executable.
> 6. Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed with two options shown in [Output 2]().
> 7. Enter the number corresponding to your preferred mode and press Enter.
> 8. To play the game depending on your selected option, follow to the prompts and directions given by the computer.
>    * If you selected to play against a human, you will be prompted to enter player names and take turns making moves on the board.
>    * If you selected to play against the computer, you will be prompted to enter your name and then play against the computer opponent.
> 9. After each round, the application is going to ask if you'd want to begin a new game. You can opt to stop playing or keep going.


## Customization 
> This code can be easily customized to meet your specific needs. Here are some things you may want to modify:
> * **Custom Symbols:** Instead of using the letters "X" and "O," players could use their own symbols (such as emojis or icons).
> * **Board Size:** You can change the game to support larger or smaller game boards, such as 4x4 or 5x5 grids, by modifying the board size and victory condition logic appropriately.
> * **Player profiles:** Customize the leaderboard to enable players to keep track of their game data, including their win-loss records and the number of games they've played.
